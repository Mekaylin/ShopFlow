This is a basic Expo Go app project. Please generate React Native/Expo compatible code and follow best practices for Expo projects.

**When asked to review or analyze the project, ALWAYS review the entire project, not just the file currently being viewed. Project-wide reviews are expected unless the user explicitly says otherwise. This is a strict requirement.**
Consider:
1. Code quality and adherence to best practices
2. Potential bugs or edge cases
3. Performance optimizations
4. Readability and maintainability
5. Any security concerns
Suggest improvements and explain your reasoning for each suggestion.


Evaluate the code across these dimensions:
   - Syntax and compilation errors
   - Logic and functional correctness
   - Performance optimization opportunities
   - Code style and best practices
   - Security considerations
   - Project-wide consistency and architectural soundness

3. Provide feedback in this structure:
   a) Status: [Error-free/Needs improvement]
   b) Critical Issues: [If any]
   c) Optimization Suggestions: [Performance/readability]
   d) Style Recommendations: [Based on language conventions]
