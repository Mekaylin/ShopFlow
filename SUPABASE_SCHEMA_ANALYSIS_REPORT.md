## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Table Relationships

#### ‚úÖ Good Practices Found:
- Proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE DELETE
- Consistent UUID primary keys
- Business_id pattern across all tables

#### ‚ùå Issues Identified:
```sql
-- Missing indexes on foreign key columns
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_business_id ON users(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employees_business_id ON employees(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_business_id ON tasks(business_id);
-- ... (8 more missing indexes)
```

#### üîß Recommended Fixes:
1. Add indexes on all business_id columns
2. Add indexes on frequently queried columns (assigned_to, completed, etc.)
3. Consider composite indexes for common query patterns

### 2. Triggers Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Good Practices Found:
- Proper trigger function structure
- SECURITY DEFINER usage for auth bypass

#### ‚ùå Issues Identified:
```sql
-- Current trigger lacks error handling
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auto_rate_completed_task()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Missing error handling
    -- No validation for NULL values
    -- Potential infinite loops
END;
```

#### üîß Recommended Fixes:
1. Add comprehensive error handling
2. Validate NULL values before processing
3. Add logging for debugging
4. Optimize queries within triggers

### 3. RLS Policies Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Good Practices Found:
- RLS enabled on all tables
- Proper auth.uid() usage in policies

#### ‚ùå Issues Identified:
```sql
-- Inefficient subqueries in policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view ratings for their business" ON task_ratings
    FOR SELECT USING (
        business_id IN (
            SELECT business_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()  -- Subquery on every row
        )
    );
```

#### üîß Recommended Fixes:
1. Optimize RLS policies to reduce subqueries
2. Add missing DELETE policies
3. Ensure all tables have comprehensive policies
4. Use JOINs instead of subqueries where possible

### 4. Database Functions Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Good Practices Found:
- SECURITY DEFINER usage for auth bypass
- Proper function structure

#### ‚ùå Issues Identified:
```sql
-- Performance calculation function needs optimization
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_performance_metrics(
    -- Multiple queries that could be combined
    -- No error handling
    -- Inefficient employee name lookup
)
```

#### üîß Recommended Fixes:
1. Combine multiple queries into single operations
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Cache employee names to avoid repeated lookups
4. Add input validation

### 5. Indexes Analysis

#### ‚ùå Critical Issues Found:
- **No indexes on business_id columns** - Major performance impact
- **Missing indexes on frequently queried columns**
- **No composite indexes for common query patterns**

#### üîß Recommended Indexes:
```sql
-- Critical performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_business_id ON users(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employees_business_id ON employees(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_business_id ON tasks(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_materials_business_id ON materials(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_task_ratings_business_id ON task_ratings(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_performance_metrics_business_id ON performance_metrics(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_clock_events_business_id ON clock_events(business_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_departments_business_id ON departments(business_id);

-- Query optimization indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_assigned_to ON tasks(assigned_to);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_completed ON tasks(completed);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_task_ratings_employee_id ON task_ratings(employee_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_task_ratings_task_id ON task_ratings(task_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_clock_events_employee_id ON clock_events(employee_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employees_name ON employees(name);
```

### 6. Auth Schema Integration

#### ‚úÖ Good Practices Found:
- Proper auth.users trigger setup
- User table exists with proper linking

#### ‚ùå Issues Identified:
- Missing comprehensive RLS policies on users table
- No proper role-based access control verification

#### üîß Recommended Fixes:
```sql
-- Add comprehensive user table policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON users
    FOR UPDATE USING (id = auth.uid());
```

### 7. Performance Considerations

#### ‚ùå Performance Issues Found:
1. **N+1 Query Patterns** - RLS policies with subqueries
2. **Missing Materialized Views** - No caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Inefficient Function Calls** - Multiple database round trips

#### üîß Performance Optimizations:
```sql
-- Create materialized view for performance data
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS employee_performance_summary AS
SELECT 
    e.id as employee_id,
    e.name as employee_name,
    e.business_id,
    COUNT(t.id) as total_tasks,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.completed = true THEN 1 END) as completed_tasks,
    COALESCE(AVG(tr.rating), 0) as average_rating,
    COUNT(tr.id) as total_ratings
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN tasks t ON t.assigned_to = e.name AND t.business_id = e.business_id
LEFT JOIN task_ratings tr ON tr.employee_id = e.id
GROUP BY e.id, e.name, e.business_id;
```

## Data Integrity Issues

### Orphaned Records Found:
- Users with NULL business_id
- Employees with NULL business_id  
- Tasks with NULL business_id

### Data Quality Issues:
- Users with missing roles
- Users with missing names
- Inconsistent data types

### üîß Data Integrity Fixes:
```sql
-- Fix orphaned records
UPDATE users 
SET business_id = (SELECT id FROM businesses LIMIT 1)
WHERE business_id IS NULL;

UPDATE employees 
SET business_id = (SELECT id FROM businesses LIMIT 1)
WHERE business_id IS NULL;

UPDATE tasks 
SET business_id = (SELECT id FROM businesses LIMIT 1)
WHERE business_id IS NULL;

-- Fix missing data
UPDATE users 
SET role = COALESCE(role, 'user')
WHERE role IS NULL OR role = '';

UPDATE users 
SET name = COALESCE(name, email)
WHERE name IS NULL OR name = '';
```

## Security Analysis

### ‚úÖ Security Strengths:
- RLS enabled on all tables
- Proper auth.uid() usage
- SECURITY DEFINER functions

### ‚ùå Security Gaps:
- Missing DELETE policies on some tables
- Incomplete role-based access control
- No comprehensive audit logging

### üîß Security Improvements:
```sql

CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete ratings for their business" ON task_ratings
    FOR DELETE USING (
        business_id IN (
            SELECT business_id FROM users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Ensure all tables have comprehensive policies
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... (all tables)
```
